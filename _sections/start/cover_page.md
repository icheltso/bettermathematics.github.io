title: About The Courses
---
An important aspect of the BetterMaths website is to provide accurate and up-to-date information about available math courses to University of Edinburgh students. 

The courses described on our pages are sorted by the years they are *typically* taken in.

However, if a course is normally taken in a later (or previous) year, it does not necessarily mean that you *cannot* take it now.

When you are choosing courses, be on the lookout for the course level. This is generally a good indicator of course difficulty. Courses of level up to and including 9 are normally taken in years 1 and 2, while level 10 and 11 courses are typically taken in years 3 through 5.

Note, that you have little choice in math courses in the first two years, as courses of higher levels are generally deemed too complex for Year 1 and 2 students. However if there is a specific course that you would like to take, do not be afraid to ask both your Personal Tutor and the course organizer for advice and/or concession for the course.

In years 3 and above, apart from your compulsory courses, you will be required to take a number of optional math courses, as this is the point where you begin to specialize on a degree. Starting in year 3 you will have more freedom both in the number of optional credits that you can take and in the difficulty of the optional courses.

Additionally, if you are on an MMath degree, you are ***required*** to take a total of 120 credits of level 11 courses over the years 4 and 5. The 40-credit dissertation in year 5 counts towards this total.

Also note that while the school advises against overloading on courses (e.g. taking 140 credits worth with a 120 limit), there is nothing actually stopping you from doing this. However, with an increased load your academic performance may suffer, especially in later years, where every course is more specialized and every credit requires more work. Again, please don't hesitate to contact your P.T. and the course organizer of the course that is causing the overload. Quite often, 20 credit and 10 credit courses require a similar amount of effort to do well in.

We hope that this section helped clear up any confusion regarding the organization of the BetterMaths website as well as the course selection process. If there are any other questions that you may have, or if you would like to propose a change to the website, or if you think that the information on the website contains an inconsistency, feel free to contact us @ {email here}.
